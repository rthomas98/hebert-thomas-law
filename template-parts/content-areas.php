        <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
        <p>
        Estate planning is simply the preparation of how you wish your property to be distributed and managed at death. For many entrepreneurs, a business is often the primary asset of their estate.

        Business Law

      <p>
      If you are starting your own business, choosing the right corporate entity is a crucial step in the start-up process. By forming the wrong entity, you could be creating potential business set-backs. A business entity should be tailored to the owners' unique business needs. Some factors that should be considered include: liability, tax consequences, management, potential capital investments, and the rights and responsibilities of the owners.

        <h3>Data Privacy Law</h3>
      <p>
      Data Privacy law pertains to the regulation, storage, and use of personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals, which can be collected by governments, public or private companies, or other individuals. In this digital age, almost all businesses have a digital presence, whether it is for marketing and advertising, information sharing, or for online retail transactions. However, having a digital presence also brings about privacy concerns, which can produce legal ramifications for businesses that are not compliant with current data privacy protection laws.
      </p>

      <p>
      At Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC, I have the knowledge and skill to help businesses understand and comply with the broad aspects of data privacy laws and standards that regulate the collection, storage, use, sharing and protection of PII, along with sensitive corporate information and trade secrets. Let us draft your internal privacy and security policy as well as your consumer privacy notice to ensure the public that you properly collect and use consumer information and are compliant with all applicable laws and industry standards.

      <h3>Trademarks</h3>
      <p>
        In todayâ€™s economy, trademarks have become one of the most powerful marketing tools used for brand identification and quality recognition for both small and large businesses. In fact, a unique trademark is often viewed as the commercial substitute of a businesses signature and can help increase its value.
      </p>
      <p>
        A trademark can consist of any letter, word, phrase, slogan, logo, or other graphic symbol that businesses use to distinguish its product from others in its industry. Generally, a trademark is owned by the business or entrepreneur that is first to use the mark in commerce - that is, the first business to use or associate the trademark with its product in the marketplace. Once the trademark is initially used in commerce, the owner may file for trademark protection and prevent others from using an identical or similar trademark to brand its product. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
      <p>
      Applying to register a trademark can be overwhelming and due to inexperience, may cost you more money if you do it alone. My firm is here to make things easier for you so you can get back to doing what you love. Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC will guide your business through the trademark application process with the State or USPTO. I can also help protect your intellectual property by representing your business in all trademark infringement cases.

      <h3>Copyrights</h3>
      <p>
      Like trademarks, copyrights are equally important intellectual property assets that require adequate protection. While copyright protection exists automatically at the time of creation, obtaining federal registration affords greater legal protection to authors of creative works. In fact, copyright registration allows the author to: provide notice to others of their ownership of the original work; prevent disputes by showing evidence of the date of creation; and easily enforce their rights to protect their work from infringement. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
<p>
      Copyrights protect original works of authorship, such as: literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, but also extends to computer software and architecture. Additionally, the copyright holder is afforded the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform and display the work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You've worked  too hard on your original work to not protect your creative expressions. Let Hebert-Thomas Law help you obtain federal registration or represent you in any copyright matter or dispute that you may encounter.

      <h3>General Counsel Services</h3>
      <p>
      Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC offers general counsel services for large businesses, growing companies, and small entrepreneurs that lack a full time in-house lawyer, but require advice on sophisticated legal matters. My corporate law services remain consistent with the clientsâ€™ entrepreneurial needs. I offer legal support in many areas, including: corporate governance, contract drafting and negotiation, labor and employment issues, regulatory matters, and litigation representation.
      </p>

      <h3>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</h3>
      <p>Simply stated, mergers and acquisitions are legal methods where the assets, liabilities, and ownership of one business entity are transferred to another. Although the two are often linked together, a merger and an acquisition are two distinctly different legal devices. An acquisition is generally the complete purchase of all stock and/or assets of another company, whereas, a merger occurs when two separate entities agree to become one entity.
        </p>
      <p>
          Mergers and acquisitions are very complex legal transactions that require, among other things, an impeccable attention to detail and an intricate strategy to be successfully executed. Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC provides legal counsel to both sellerâ€™s selling a business and to buyerâ€™s seeking to purchase a business throughout the entire M&A process. Here's how I can help:
