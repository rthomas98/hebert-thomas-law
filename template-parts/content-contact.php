      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>
      Thank you for your interest in Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC. I offer initial consultations that are conducted by phone. The consultation generally lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. Please note, however, the initial consultation with our firm does NOT establish an attorney-client relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
      After your initial consultation, should you wish to hire my firm, it is require that you sign an engagement agreement and provide a retainer. This is the only way to establish an attorney-client relationship with Hebert-Thomas Law, PLLC. Once all services have been rendered, any remaining retainer balance will be promptly refunded to you.
