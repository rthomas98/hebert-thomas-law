                <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
                <p>
                    Estate planning is simply the preparation of how you wish your property to be distributed and managed during your lifetime and upon your death. Everyone should have an estate plan despite their socio-economic status. Estate plans involve so much more than just a will, as there are tools to help you in case of incapacity and for financial planning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many entrepreneurs, a business is often a primary asset of their estate. As such, the death or incapacity of a business owner can leave many unanswered questions regarding the future of their business if certain procedures are not in place.

                <h2>Probate</h2>
                <p>
                    Losing a loved one is difficult and can often leave you feeling emotionally distraught. What’s more is that you are typically tasked with planning funeral arrangements. However, there are also legal considerations that must be addressed regarding the decedent’s estate. Whether  or not your loved one had a will, the decedent’s property must be transferred to the beneficiaries or heirs and all debts must be settled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My firm is here to help you through the probate process. Hebert-Thomas Law can help in the following ways:

            <h2>Guardianship</h2>
            <p>
                A guardianship is the process by which someone is granted legal authority and duty of care of a ward’s person, property, or both. A ward is simply a legal term for a person who is incapable of managing his affairs due to infancy, incapacity, or disability. It is not required that a guardian of the person and a guardian of the estate be the same person. In some instances, a limited guardianship may be appointed if it is in the best interest of the ward.

            <h3>Guardian of the Person</h3>
            <p>
                Appointments for a guardianship of the person typically arise where the person is unable to reasonably care for his or her personal, medical, or welfare needs. This typically involves adults who lack capacity, has a disability, or minors.

            <h3>Guardian of the Estate</h3>
            <p>
                Appointments for a guardianship of the estate involve the management of that person’s financial affairs when a ward is incapable of making prudent financial decisions regarding his or her assets.
