            <h2>Trademarks</h2>
            <p>
                In today’s economy, trademarks have become one of the most powerful marketing tools used for brand identification and quality recognition for both small and large businesses. In fact, a unique trademark is often viewed as the commercial substitute of a businesses signature and can help increase its value.
            </p>
            <p>
                A trademark can consist of any letter, word, phrase, slogan, logo, or other graphic symbol that businesses use to distinguish its product from others in its industry.

                    Generally, a trademark is owned by the business or entrepreneur that is first to use the mark in commerce - that is, the first business to use or associate the trademark with its product in the marketplace. Once the trademark is initially used in commerce, the owner may file for trademark protection and prevent others from using an identical or similar trademark to brand its product.
                </p>
                <p>

            <h2>Copyrights</h2>
            <p>
                Like trademarks, copyrights are equally important intellectual property assets that require adequate protection. While copyright protection exists automatically at the time of creation, obtaining federal registration affords greater legal protection to authors of creative works. In fact, copyright registration allows the author to: provide notice to others of their ownership of the original work; prevent disputes by showing evidence of the date of creation; and easily enforce their rights to protect their work from infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copyrights protect original works of authorship, such as: literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, but also extends to computer software and architecture. Additionally, the copyright holder is afforded the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform and display the work.
            </p>
