                <h2>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</h2>
                <p>
                    Simply stated, mergers and acquisitions are legal methods where the assets, liabilities, and ownership of one business entity are transferred to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the two are often linked together, a merger and an acquisition are two distinctly different legal devices. An acquisition is generally the complete purchase of all or a substantial portion of stock and/or assets of another company, whereas, a merger occurs when two separate entities agree to become one entity.
