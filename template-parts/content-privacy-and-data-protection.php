                Privacy & Data Protection Law
            </h2>

            <p>
                Data Protection law pertains to the regulation, storage, and use of personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals, which can be collected by governments, public or private companies, or other individuals. In this digital age, almost all businesses have a digital presence, whether it is for marketing and advertising, information sharing, or for online retail transactions. However, having a digital presence also brings about privacy concerns, which can produce legal ramifications for businesses that are not compliant with current data privacy protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the implementation of GDPR and CCPA, the privacy and data protection phenomenon is being recognized as a fundamental right worldwide. In the near future, businesses can expect further regulation, both globally and domestically and will need to remain compliant. Whatâ€™s more is that regulators are enforcing data privacy violations now, more than ever, and consequences for such violations include hefty fines.
