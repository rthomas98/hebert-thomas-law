                <h2>Business Entity Formation</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are starting your own business, choosing the right corporate entity is a crucial step in the start-up process. By forming the wrong entity, you could be creating potential business set-backs. A business entity should be tailored to the owners’ unique business needs. Some factors that should be considered include: liability, tax consequences, management, potential capital investments, and the rights and responsibilities of the owners.
